# Amiga Demo: Defender of the Amiga
This little demo was supposed to be my entry to Instanssi 2022 demo competition, but the event was canceled.

The playsid.library and the includes related to it are from the following package:
https://aminet.net/package/mus/play/PlaySID3

The ProTracker tune is from the Aminet.
The Commodore 64's SID tune is from the High Voltage SID collection.

The graphics used in this demo are free and allowed to be modified.

This my first bigger Amiga coding project for a long time.. So.. Forgive.. The code is quite messy..
