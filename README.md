# Amiga Demo: Defender of the Amiga
This little demo was supposed to be my entry to Instanssi 2022 demo competition, but the event was canceled.

The playsid.library and the includes related to it are from the following package:
https://aminet.net/package/mus/play/PlaySID3

The ProTracker tune is from the Aminet.
The Commodore 64's SID tune is from the High Voltage SID collection.

The graphics used in this demo are free and allowed to be modified.

This is my first bigger Amiga coding project for a long time.. So.. Forgive.. The code is quite messy..

I have included also an Amiga executable file (195520 bytes) in case the compiling fails from some reason.. Some parts of the demo can be skipped with the left mousebutton.

# Amiga system needed

An AGA Amiga with probably 2mb CHIP ram and some FAST ram + 68040 CPU.

With emulation the demo works fine with Amiga Forever with Workbench 3.x configured for 68040 CPU. Works fine with proper configuration on AmiKit, too.
